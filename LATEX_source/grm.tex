\begin{frame}{Abstracting to a Mathematical Problem}	
\begin{block}{Problem Statement:}
Design distributed control algorithms for large networks of mobile robots such that the group shows a desirable behavior.
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Desirable behaviors we consider:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Consensus and/or Formation stabilization
		\item Flocking with/without source seeking
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Complexity in solving the problem can stem through:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Complicated dynamics of individual agents
		\item Commplicated Interconnection structure and intractible design algorithms for large networks
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Approaching the problem: Divide and Conquer}
\begin{block}{Available literature on}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Control of single complex agent dynamics (e.g LPV, control of differetially flat systems, dynamic inversion) 
	\item Distributed control of large networks of "simple" agent dynamics (e.g single and double intergrators) -> Consensus and Flocking algorithms
\end{itemize}
\end{block}	
\begin{block}{Consider as building blocks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Closed-loop system $G_{\textnormal{cl}}$ with some guaranteed performance measure such as the induced $\mathcal{L}_2-\mathcal{L}_2$ or  $\mathcal{L}_2-\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norms
	\item Consensus or Flocking algorithms for "simple" systems
